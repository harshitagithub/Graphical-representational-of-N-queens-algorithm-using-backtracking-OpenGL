# Graphical-representational-of-N-queens-algorithm-using-backtracking-OpenGL

The entire project is made using an industry standard 3D GRAPHICS API called OpenGL.

Instructions to execute:

-> This project has been made using CODEBLOCKS.

-> It includes a well know Library called OPENGL.

-> Set these up and you are ready to run the code.

WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES?

N-queens is a NP-HARD problem i.e. it is computationally very expensive.
Solving this problem for larger number of queens using brute-force method takes a lot of computational power. So the other simple way to deal with this problem is to make use of BACKTRACKING.
BACKTRACKING is a simple approach to solve this problem.
Trying to solve this problem is difficult in the first go, so this project demonstrates the way in BACKTRACKING is applied to solve this problem.

this project has three options to make the movements of the queens more understandable.
first option shows the movements along with the danger-positions at which the other queens cannot be placed.
the second option only shows the movements of the queens with no danger-spots.
the third option shows the final positions of the queen directly with no movements.
